# Containerized Honeypot
## Cowrie honeypot in docker

This project sets up a Cowrie honeypot within a Docker container to detect and log unauthorized SSH access attempts. Cowrie emulates a vulnerable system, capturing detailed logs of attacker activities for analysis. The project includes steps to deploy the honeypot, simulate an attack, and analyze the captured data.

## Steps to Set Up and Use the Cowrie Honeypot

### 1. Build the Docker Image
First, build the Docker image for the Cowrie honeypot.

```bash
docker build -t cowrie-honeypot .
```
### 2. Run the Cowrie Container
Next, run the Cowrie honeypot container.

```bash
docker run -d --name cowrie -p 2222:2222 cowrie-honeypot
```

### 3. Simulate an SSH Attack
To test the honeypot, simulate an SSH attack by attempting to connect to it.

```bash
ssh -p 2222 root@localhost
```

### 4. Access and Analyze Logs
Logs generated by Cowrie are stored in the `/cowrie/log` directory inside the container. Access and analyze these logs to understand attacker activities.

```bash
docker exec -it cowrie /bin/bash
cat /cowrie/log/cowrie.json
```

### 5. Copy Logs to Host for Analysis
For further analysis, copy the logs from the container to your host machine.

```bash
docker cp cowrie:/cowrie/log/cowrie.json ./cowrie_logs/
```

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you will have a fully operational Cowrie honeypot running in a Docker container, ready to detect and log unauthorized access attempts. This setup provides valuable insights into attacker methods and behaviors.
